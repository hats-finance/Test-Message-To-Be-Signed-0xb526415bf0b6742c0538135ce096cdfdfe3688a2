Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\\n *\\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\\n *\\n * For example:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```\\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\\n *         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\\n *\\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\\n *\\n * [CAUTION]\\n * ====\\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\\n *\\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker.

specific project's bug bounties.\\n * Anyone can permissionlessly deposit into the HATVault using\\n * the vault\\u2019s native token. When a bug is submitted and approved, the bounty \\n * is paid out using the funds in the vault. Bounties are paid out as a\\n * percentage of the vault. The percentage is set according to the severity of\\n * the bug. Vaults have regular safety periods (typically for an hour twice a\\n * day) which are time for the committee to make decisions.\\n *\\n * In addition to the roles defined in the HATVaultsRegistry, every HATVault \\n * has the roles:\\n * Committee - The only address which can submit a claim for a bounty payout\\n * and set the maximum bounty.\\n * User - Anyone can deposit the vault's native token into the vault and \\n * recieve shares for it. Shares represent the user's relative part in the\\n * vault, and when a bounty is paid out, users lose part of their deposits\\n * (based on percentage paid), but keep their share of the vault.\\n * Users also receive rewards for their deposits, which can be claimed at any\\n *  time.\\n * To withdraw previously deposited tokens, a user must first send a withdraw\\n * request, and the withdrawal will be made available after a pending period.\\n * Withdrawals are not permitted during safety periods or while there is an \\n * active claim for a bounty payout.\\n *\\n * Bounties are payed out distributed between a few channels, and that \\n * distribution is set upon creation (the hacker gets part in direct transfer,\\n * part in vested reward and part in vested HAT token, part gets rewarded to\\n * the committee, part gets swapped to HAT token and burned and/or sent to Hats\\n * governance).\\n *\\n * NOTE: Vaults should not use tokens which do not guarantee that the amount\\n *
